# Warcry Modified
# Introduction:
Fixed by, Tyrelis an old project of mine warmarch, warhearth.
Hopefully someone will finish this in my stead. Sadly this project was made to work on XAMPP (Windows Apache/PHP/MySQL Web tool) wich is not very good for live sites (bad security). I tryied to fix some files to make it work on linux web-server. (You must switch apache fast-cgi to apache handlers for this to work). Lot's of code updated is required due deprectated functions on this project. But i will upgrade some when i will have some spare times. I also started a project called WoWEmU CMS that i intend to continue :D but in the last period i didn't find time to work on it :(.
